Final Programming Assignment 

The project should be something of your own choosing, perhaps something you would be interested in continuing to work on for selling on the app store. 
It should be about the same difficulty as our weekly assignments. If you are not sure about the topic you choose, send me an email and I will approve it or suggest changes. 
You should not just copy some project off the Internet -- that would be academic dishonesty. I don't mind if you use code from another source, 
but give attribution where you got it from, and do not use anyone else's copyrighted code unless they give permission.

Simple Calculator App 

Background – For my Final Program I developed a calculator with functions that Add, Subtract, Multiply, 
Divide and use percentage while also implementing a decimal point. Functions as a simple calculator 
with simple commands. 
Error States – If the user was to enter an equation symbol as the only value, then the interface will send 
a validation warning telling the user that it is invalid (% Sign is only one without Invalid Error State).
