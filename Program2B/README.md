Programming Assignment 2B

In this assignment you are to turn the loan calculator playground you did in the previous module into an app. The user interface of your app should have text fields to enter

The loan amount (a float)
The number of payment periods (an integer)
The interest rate PER PAYMENT PERIOD (a float) 
Each of these text fields should have a label in front of it that tells what that text field is for. Below the text fields and their labels, you should also have a button labelled "Calculate Payment" to calculate the payment. Its action method should use the code from your playground to calculate the payment. 

Below the button should be a label that shows the amount of the payment, along with text telling you that this is the amount of the payment.
