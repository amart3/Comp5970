Programming Assignment Directions

You are to develop an app with an ImageView and three buttons. The ImageView should be roughly 300x300 pixels, 50 pixels from the top of the screen, and centered horizontally. Below the ImageView should be three buttons, each centered horizontally one above the other and spaced to pleasantly sit below the ImageView on some recent model of iPhone or iPod Touch (tell what one you used in a comment with your assignment).  The top button should be labeled “War Eagle” and the bottom button should be labeled “Roll Tide” and the middle one “SEC”

 

When you load the app, the ImageView should have the Southseastern Conference logo. When you press the War Eagle button an AU logo should load. When you press the Roll Tide button a ‘Bama logo should load.  When you press the SEC one the Southeastern Conference logo should load. This should work no matter what order the 3 buttons are pressed. That should continue to happen as many times as you press each button.

 

*** Be sure to include the image files as part of the project directory rather than links to somewhere else on your  computer. If you don’t, your project won’t compile for me.

 

Deliverables

Zip up the directory containing your project and upload it to Canvas to turn it in. I will build and run your project from that directory. To make my life easier, name your project based on your AU userid as follows, EXACTLY. If your userid is “roc0012”,  name it  “Prog1roc00012Fa16” (no spaces).  This makes it a lot easier to keep track of whose I am grading than if  I have 35 zip files all named “Program 1”. Thanks.
